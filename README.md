# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
After discussing with a friend, I believe it would probably be a good idea to build a knowledge graph of the history events that I learned. This graph will quantify the events which I make the most connections, or the evnets which isolates from my knowldege net.

# Problems to be solved<a name="Installation"></a>
1) How to abstract these knowledge automatically?
2) How to solve name ambigiouity of events?
3) Is there a better way to build this graph?
4) Can I make it an online tool?
5) What conclusions can I make from this graph?

# File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
Thes csv files are the original graph data
Cypher file contain command to import data into neo4j
